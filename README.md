## Abstract
	This project is designed to offer a way to track time spent on particular activities. Users can select whether the activity is studying, meditating, or exercising and then refine that to a more specific goal as well as choosing how long to do that activity. After the user has filled all those categories out, they will be brought to a page with a timer that matches their time entered. Users can then activate the timer at their leisure and complete their activity. When they are done, they can log their activity to be saved on the right side of the screen.
